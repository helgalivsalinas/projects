          <p>“For a long, long time, I would drive by the checkpoints and see the hispanic agents and say ‘what are these guys doing,'" the Tucson resident reflects. “Most of it comes from a lack of understanding of what goes on and what the job’s about.”</p> <p>For many people living in border counties, this once adverse position of being a border patrol agent has became a desirable career choice. “The main reason is stability. Since 2008, it really doesn't feel secure, especially in the job I did. You always feel vulnerable."</p>

          They see their uncle in uniform as a border patrol agent and most of the parents on their soccer team are also agents. 

“ ‘Wow that’s great dad’ I doubt they completely understand..they know it’s a  position of authority, they know that my brother-in-law walks around with a handgun very infrequently...they know it’s honorable, respectable,” says the source referring to his 9-year-olds reactions when he explained the possibility of him becoming an agent.  

“My wife is a banker...I don’t think she’s ever been as supportive with anything as she has with this,” said our source. “She’s done the cost and benefit analysis...she knows things are going to get better for us...yeah i might be gone a lot more but  we’ll finish getting out of debt sooner, putting money away for the kid’s school much quicker...she knows it’s a good thing.”
